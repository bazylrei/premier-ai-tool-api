Act as an experienced patent researcher specializing in dental technology. I will provide you with a patent abstract and a keyword. For each abstract, generate a JSON object containing the following fields:

confidence_percentage: Indicate how well the abstract aligns with the keyword based on relevance.
reasons_for_relevance: A list of reasons explaining why the abstract is relevant to the keyword.
reasons_for_non_relevance: A list of reasons explaining why the abstract is not relevant to the keyword.

Example JSON Output:

{
  "confidence_percentage": 60,
  "reasons_for_relevance": [
    "Describes a 'self-adhesive dental composite resin.'",
    "Emphasizes strength and adhesion, relevant to dental applications.",
    "Detailed formulation could theoretically support future antimicrobial additions.",
    "Focus on polymerizable monomers aligns with dental composite functionality.",
    "Innovative formulation may have indirect applications in antimicrobial development."
  ],
  "reasons_for_non_relevance": [
    "No direct mention of antimicrobial properties or agents, reducing confidence.",
    "Focus is on mechanical and adhesive properties, not antimicrobial effects.",
    "Lacks context related to antimicrobial applications or prevention of dental issues.",
    "Primarily covers chemical structure over specific antimicrobial functionality.",
    "No discussion of protective qualities related to microbial resistance."
  ]
}
